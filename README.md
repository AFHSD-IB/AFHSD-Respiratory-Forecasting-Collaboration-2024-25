2024-2025 DoD AFHSD-IB Respiratory Forecasting Collaboration

Introduction

To provide insight on the burden and trajectory of respiratory diseases in DoD-relevant locations in the U.S. and globally, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Integrated Biosurveillance Branch (AFHSD-IB) will undertake a collaborative comparison of respiratory illness encounter forecasts for the 2024-2025 influenza season. Beginning in October 2024, AFHSD-IB is hosting a forecasting collaboration to provide forecasts of ICD-coded medical encounters for COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the DoD population in select AFHSD Surveillance Markets.

Eligibility

All, including academic institutions and private organizations, are welcome to participate in this collaborative endeavor. Participants must complete a Defense Health Agency (DHA) Data Sharing Agreement to receive weekly de-identified and aggregated datasets of disease activity by market via DoD SAFE. Data will be provided from the DoD Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (DoD ESSENCE).

Forecasting Challenge

The Forecasting Collaboration period will run from MMWR week 40 (week beginning Sunday, September 29th, 2024) through MMWR week 20 (week ending Saturday, May 17th, 2025). The first forecasts will be based on weekly data through MMWR week 40, while final forecasts will be based on weekly data through MMWR week 20. Timely submissions will be incorporated into an ensemble model. Data will be provided on Thursdays by 11:59pm ET and forecasts should be submitted on Mondays by 11:59pm ET.

Forecasting targets will include 1 through 4-week ahead percentages of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. Forecasts may be provided for any of the 121 AFHSD Market locations. Teams interested in participating in the DoD AFHSD-IB Respiratory Forecasting Collaboration are invited to submit forecasts from multiple models. It is recommended that teams provide forecasts for locations and targets for which they believe their models are well-suited. Furthermore, it is required that forecasts provide quantile forecasts (i.e., 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, etc...) and point predictions for each target in a comma-separated value (CSV) files.
